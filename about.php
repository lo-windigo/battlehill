			As the owners and brewers of Battle Hill Brewing Company, we are 
excited to join the local brewing scene as the area’s newest Farm Brewery.  </p>
		<p>
Like many of our peers, we started as home brewers.  As time went by we asked:  
What if..?   So we began to consider doing this as a career; after all, what 
could be better than getting paid to do something you love!
		</p>
		<p>
Around the same time as the New York State Farm Brewery Bill, we got serious 
about the idea of a brewery.  Plans were made, numbers crunched and a business 
plan drawn up…things evolved and time went by and we kept moving forward.
		</p>
		<p>
Early in 2014 the planets lined up, Battle Hill Brewing Company was formed, we 
found a home in a cool 19th century building in historic Fort Ann - and the rest 
is history.  </p>
		<p>
Our vision is to create and share our ales 7 barrels at a time, using fresh 
local ingredients and our refined recipes and brewing practices. Washington 
County, NY has a long  and varied agricultural history and we’re honored to be 
part of that, and to hopefully play a part in the resurgence of the area. We 
think the craft beer and wine industry is a great fit for the county, and we’re 
very excited to be part of this community. It’s likely that soon the whole farm 
to glass experience can be had without leaving our county! 
		</p>
		<p>
			We look forward to innovating, brewing and keeping it local. We 
think our beers will make you happy… come see us, have a pint and take some 
home to enjoy!
